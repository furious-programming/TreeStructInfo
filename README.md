This document is highly abbreviated version of the format specification. Full form of [official **TreeStructInfo 1.0** format specification](http://treestruct.info/pl/format/1.0.htm) is available on the [project website](http://treestruct.info) (unfortunately, for now only in Polish).

[Detailed documentation of this API](http://treestruct.info/pl/api/official-1.0-objpas/index.htm) to handle the **TreeStructInfo** files and the [tutorial](http://treestruct.info/pl/api/official-1.0-objpas/tutorial/index.htm) are also available on the [project website](http://treestruct.info) (also only in Polish).

# Introduction

**TreeStructInfo** is a project of the universal format for text and binary configuration files, for storing settings of applications and games in the form of data trees. Allows to create a single-file configurations and complex configuration systems, consisting of many interrelated files.

Format is human-friendly - text files syntax is based on a linear structure and small set of keywords. Text form gives the possibility to create an open configurations. Binary form provides faster files processing, maintaining compatibility of native data in memory with a text form.

# Sample file

I can not use my own syntax highlighting, so if you want to see the sample text file, go to the [**sample file** point in specification](http://treestruct.info/pl/format/1.0.htm#idSampleFile).
